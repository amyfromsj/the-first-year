      <strong>HAPPY 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY HONEY! ♡</strong><br> <br> This whole year has been full of happiness and excitement, but also some
      loss and growth. Yet in every situation, you always
      make me feel so safe. The security you provide makes me so careless that I'll go out into the world doing some
      dumb shit when we go out (like that one time I said out loud that I'd rather have body dysmorphia than be fat, 2
      minutes after saying something racist [why are you dating me bro]). I swear I've always been a really careful
      person. Having you by my side allows me to be that free spirited kid I used to be, and it's so cathartic to
      be so uninhibited again.
      <br><br>
      To be honest, I've been thinking about this 1-year milestone since the beginning. I was so
      confident we'd get to this point, I never questioned whether it would happen, only thought about when it would
      happen. <br><br> <strong>A SMOL RECAP • ◡ •</strong> <br><br> The first few months of dating were so exciting and
      wild. We
      were strangers whose paths crossed - all because we had the same idea, at the same time. Now, we are one year in
      and we still
      get the same ideas. However, it's different since we'll have the same idea, say the same thing at the same time,
      and then
      cringe afterwards about how gross we are. This is what I love about us - we laugh at everything (even
      existentially at the relationship). <br><br> Another difference is that we don't get
      the same butterflies when we text each other (LOL imagine if we did that'd be crazy because we text so often).
      However our relationship feels peaceful and homey. Nowadays, I get excited about coming home to you after work,
      and pp-ing you to sleep. <br><br>  <small>(HOWEVER THE HONEYMOON PERIOD DOESN'T EXIST, OK? I WILL ALWAYS FEEL
        HONEYMOONEY.)</small> <br><br> In
      the beginning I told you to savor our time together (when we were both unemployed and spent 24/7 together). I
      said it was a luxury to have so much time for each other, because I knew one day we'd start working towards our
      future and supporting <s>our expensive hobbies</s> ourselves. Now that time has come, and we're making that future a
      reality (yay!). We definitely have less
      time together, but it makes me so happy to know we're taking care of our future. <br><br> I love you so much and I
      just want to let you know you make me so happy. You are my most favorite human ever, and also the most annoying person at the
      same time. I look forward to each day we have ahead of us and I can't wait for us to move in hehe. <br><br> This letter is only a
      drop of
      water from the ocean of my feelings for you. I love you more than i can express in words. <br> <br>Happy 1 year
      honey! <br> <br> To
      many more,
      <BR><BR>
        <br> <br>
